"""
Internal Token Middleware
-------------------------
Protects all /api/* routes from direct external access.

Only the Next.js frontend knows the SYNAPSE_INTERNAL_TOKEN and injects it
as an X-Synapse-Internal header on every proxied request. External callers
that try to hit /api/settings, /api/agents, etc. directly will get 403.

Rules:
- /api/v1/*, /api/v2/*, ... → SKIP (external versioned API; uses API key auth instead)
- /docs, /openapi.json, /redoc  → SKIP (FastAPI docs)
- /auth/*            → SKIP (OAuth redirects; browser-navigated, cannot carry a header)
- /api/*, /chat*     → REQUIRE X-Synapse-Internal header
- If SYNAPSE_INTERNAL_TOKEN is not set → LOOPBACK-ONLY: allow requests whose
  direct peer is 127.0.0.1/::1 (local dev, same-container proxy) and 403 any
  remote caller. This closes the unauthenticated-RCE hole on network-exposed
  token-less deployments (GHSA-3j67-x3j8-r32x). Docker images auto-generate a
  token (docker/entrypoint.sh) so they never rely on this fallback.

Why /chat is gated even though it is not under /api/:
  POST /chat and /chat/stream (core/routes/chat.py) run the full ReAct loop with
  the complete tool surface — bash, execute_python, SQL, every MCP server. They
  are mounted at the root, so the "not /api/ → skip" rule let any caller who
  could reach the port drive them with no credentials at all.
  The public, externally-authenticated chat API is /api/v1/chat (require_api_key)
  — a different route. Root /chat is reached only by the Next.js route handler
  (frontend/src/app/api/chat/**), which already sends X-Synapse-Internal via
  backendHeaders(), so gating it is transparent to the UI.
