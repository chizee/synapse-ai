"""
Enforce the dependency-pinning policy (runs in the gate).

Synapse shipped a release where a fresh install silently pulled mcp 2.0.0 — a
breaking SDK rewrite — because `mcp` was declared as a bare package name. Every
native tool server died at import and the product started with no tools. CI never
noticed: it installed the same unpinned requirements and its tests didn't touch
the MCP boot path.

The policy that prevents a repeat:

  * every direct dependency carries an upper bound, so a new major release can
    never arrive unannounced;
  * `backend/requirements.lock` pins the full transitive tree, so installers and
    CI resolve byte-identical environments.

These tests guard the policy itself. Without them the bounds erode one
convenience edit at a time — the previous rationale for bare names is still
visible in git history, and it read as a feature.
