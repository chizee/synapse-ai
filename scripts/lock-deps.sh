# Regenerate the backend dependency lockfiles.
#
# Why this exists: Synapse once declared `mcp` as a bare package name. A fresh
# install resolved the mcp 2.0.0 rewrite, every native tool server died at
# import, and the backend came up with no tools. Upper bounds in
# requirements*.txt stop the next *major* release; this lock stops everything
# else, including the transitive tree (onnxruntime, tokenizers, starlette,
# chromadb) which can break users just as easily.
#
# The locks are `--universal`: one file resolves correctly across Python
# 3.11-3.14 and linux/macOS/Windows, using environment markers. Installers and
# CI read the lock; requirements*.txt stays the human-edited spec.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/lock-deps.sh          # regenerate all locks
#   ./scripts/lock-deps.sh --check  # fail if the locks are stale (used in CI)
#
# Regenerating is a deliberate, reviewable commit. Read the diff — an unexpected
# major version bump in there is exactly the signal this machinery exists to give.
